# Flow Free Game Solution
This was a project for the class of COMP20003 at The University of Melbourne.

In this project, a solver was required for the Flow Free Game. This game is yet another proof that William Rowan Hamilton was ahead of his time. Flow free is another instance of a NP-complete game being wildly successful and addictive.

Used A* instead of Djikstra Variation to search for the node.
